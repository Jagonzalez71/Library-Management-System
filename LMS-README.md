Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the management of books, authors, and customer transactions.
Key features include:

Book Management: Load and organize book data from a CSV file, allowing for efficient tracking of ISBNs, titles, authors, genres, and availability.

Customer Management: Register customers and track their borrowed books, including late return checks and borrowing limits.

Search and Recommendations: Implement search functionality to find books by title, author, or ISBN, and recommend books based on borrowed genres.

Waitlist Management: Allow customers to join waitlists for books that are currently unavailable.

This project demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, data structures, and file handling, creating an intuitive interface for library management.
